Helped develop the progress tracker for training. It worked well stepping through the process iteratively to what I wanted.
It came with some bugs, but it fixed them itself by walking through what was going wrong.

I didn't really understand how pre-trained tokenization was supposed to work. I didn't end up using any code directly from it,
but some of the approaches may be similar.


Helped with dimension disagreements, tensor creation, and generation function

There was an issue with the same token being repeated every for every new token. GPT 4o helped write a simple if statement that avoided this after multinomial sampling suggestions. In this case, GPT was used for ease and accuracy.
